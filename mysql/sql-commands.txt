select customernumber,orderno,orderDate from orders o order by orderno
select productCode from ordersdetails od
select productName from products p 

merge them 

select customernumber,o.orderNumber,orderDate,p.productCode,productName from orders o, orderdetails od,products p  where o.orderNumber=od.orderNumber and od.productCode=p.productCode order by o.orderNumber

fetch detail of those customers who have never made payments
